We know very little of the person who was said to have written the Iliad and the Odyssey. His name was Homer. The Greeks tell us that he was blind and that, as he got old, he wandered about reciting his verses and getting food and shelter where he could. After he was dead, those who had paid little attention to him realized the power and beauty of what he had written.
The Iliad and the Odyssey were very important in the life of the Greeks. They were more to the Greeks than any poems we know are to us. They were recited by people trained to recite them, and audiences listened to them as they would to plays or music today. Often the rhapsodists, as the reciters of Homer were called, performed before twenty thousand people or more.
To some extent, these poems were like the Bible. In the Iliad and Odyssey, written a little while before the Jews were beginning to set down the Bible, Homer had described how brave and wise people behaved. He had written prayers to the gods of the Greeks. He had described how courteous men and women treated their friends and strangers who came to them.
Also he showed , in the way he wrote the poems, how to say things simply, yet with words that clashed like shields or flowed like show music. His poems seldom waste language. They say directly what they have to say. Yet they manage to say it so well that we seldom forget it. Some poets started making poetry and make too much of it. Homer rarely did this. He knew when to say little and when to say much. The Greeks saw how fine a thing it was to do this. “Measure [moderation] is best in all things,” was their idea of conduct. These are words Homer had put into the mouth of Menelaus, and if he was not the first to bring this sense of proportion to the Greeks, he was foremost among those who helped them to praise and to practice it. And we today, often dashing about with very little idea of moderation, still pause to listen to Homer’s words, to talk about them and try to follow them.
